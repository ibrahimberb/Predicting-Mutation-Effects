This folder provides python functions for protein-protein interaction network analyses - 
	
	Compile_protein_interfaces.py
	    - Codes to define a high-quality human protein-protein interaction network, in which the interface of each interaction is mapped at residue resolution.
	
	Calculate_interface_enrichment.py
	    - A function to calculate the enrichment of a given set of mutations on protein interaction interfaces.
	
	Compute_network_properties.py
	    - Functions to compute network properties (degree and betweenness) of specific proteins and protein interactions in the interactome.
